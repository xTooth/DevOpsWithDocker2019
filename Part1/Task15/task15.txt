This took way longer than it should have since I didnt really have any repos with intelligent content that werent setup using gradle, maven or some other indepth stack that all seemed to require 
multi staged Dockerfiles. So this might be a complete hackjob but it builds and runs. (this is also why I attached the dockerfile.)
